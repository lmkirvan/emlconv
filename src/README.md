## emlconv 

This program is a utility to convert eml files (single emails) into markdown. 

My usecase is to be able to email myself stuff and semi-automatically convert it to an obsidian note. Also I'm trying to learn a "real" programming language. Here I'm giving rust a shot, but will maybe try to recreate in Go as well? Or Ocaml. 

Can have the body be returned as plain text or html.
